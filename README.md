# IPP

IPP is a location-based, on-chain-verifiable clinical-records app for Chilean
doctors and medical staff (Spanish UI). It is built as a **prototype /
demonstrator** of a reusable template - GPS + augmented data capture on iOS,
backed by a Bun service on Neon Postgres, with each record's hash anchored to
**Cardano** (through the **EffectStream / Paima Engine** packages) so the data
can be cryptographically verified later.

The app pairs **GPS** (where each patient lives) with **augmented data** (live
population context shown as you work) and a **gamified** contribution layer that
makes the dataset grow.

## What this is

- **An iOS app** (SwiftUI) for capturing a ~70-question women's-health intake
  form across four sections.
- **A web dashboard** (Vite + React + Leaflet) for population maps, filters,
  feedback, and on-chain verification - also embedded inside the iOS app.
- **A Bun + Fastify backend** on Neon Postgres, with a swappable chain adapter.
- **A reusable template**: the form is schema-driven, the chain is one
  interface, and the anchor pattern is generic - so the same shape powers any
  "private data, publicly verifiable" location app.

## Why GPS + AR (augmented data)

GPS is the backbone: every patient has an address that geocodes to a
latitude/longitude. That location unlocks **augmented reality for the data** -
augmenting what the clinician sees, in two places:

1. **At capture.** As you enter a value, the field shows the population context
   for it - the **local** (the patient's own locality), **país** (country), and
   **mundo** (world) average or share. You see, in the moment, how this patient
   compares to their neighbours and to everyone.
2. **On the map.** Doctors draw **notes and named areas** over the filtered
   population layer, turning patterns into plans - e.g. *"many patients in this
   zone need X, assign a specialist and schedule exams here."*

> This is augmentation of the **data and decision**, not a camera/ARKit overlay -
> the "reality" being augmented is the clinician's view of the population, keyed
> to where the patient lives.

**Why we prioritized it:** women's-health and pelvic-floor risk cluster
geographically. Location-aware context at the point of capture (and on the map)
turns a plain intake form into a population-health instrument: spot clusters,
size the radius of affectation, and act locally.

## New use-cases this enables

- **Location-aware data entry** - contextual local/país/mundo benchmarks while
  filling each field.
- **Map-driven intervention planning** - annotate zones and assign specialists /
  exams where the data shows need.
- **Population studies** - filter a cohort by medical stats (not by name),
  measure a radius of affectation in km, export the anonymized cohort to CSV.
- **Verifiable multi-site studies** - publish a study whose dataset anyone can
  validate against a single on-chain root, without exposing any record.

## How it's integrated

### GPS / location

- iOS `AddressPicker` ([ios/IPP/Components/AddressPicker.swift](ios/IPP/Components/AddressPicker.swift))
  uses `CoreLocation` to geocode a Chilean address into `latitude`/`longitude`,
  stored on the `direccion` answer.
- The web map ([web/src/components/MapView.tsx](web/src/components/MapView.tsx))
  renders an anonymized population heat layer with **Leaflet + OpenStreetMap**
  (no API key), a **distance radius in km**, and schema-derived **filters**
  ([web/src/components/MapFilters.tsx](web/src/components/MapFilters.tsx)) so a
  study is built on medical stats, never on names.

### Augmented data - at capture

`GET /api/v1/field-stats` aggregates each field across three scopes by haversine
distance from the patient (local / país / mundo); the iOS form renders them as a
discreet line under the input (`StatCaption` in
[ios/IPP/Views/DynamicFormView.swift](ios/IPP/Views/DynamicFormView.swift)) -
averages for numbers, % "sí" for booleans, the selected option's share for
pickers.

### Augmented data - on the map

Over the filtered population layer, doctors place **notes** and draw **named
areas** ([AnnotationsLayer](web/src/components/AnnotationsLayer.tsx),
[DrawingController](web/src/components/DrawingController.tsx),
[AnnotationsList](web/src/components/AnnotationsList.tsx)) to mark interventions -
the manual planning layer that turns a cluster into "assign a specialist here."
(Again: augmented *data*, not a camera overlay.)

### Engine

The chain sync runs on the **EffectStream (Paima Engine)** packages: a primitive
streams Cardano transaction metadata and projects it into an `ipp_anchors` table
the backend reads as ordinary app state. (See [Cardano anchor](#cardano-anchor).)

## Gamification (core)

Gamification is not a side feature - it is how the dataset grows and stays
honest. Every contribution scores points, a **leaderboard** ranks the team, and
that does two things:

- **Social regulation** - participation is visible. Who is registering patients,
  filling fields thoroughly, and searching the data is on the board for the whole
  team to see.
- **Rewarding high performers** - the doctors who contribute the most are
  exactly the ones positioned to author studies and papers from the data, so the
  incentive compounds: more (and better) data → better studies → more reason to
  contribute.

Points model (see [ios/IPP/Views/LeaderboardView.swift](ios/IPP/Views/LeaderboardView.swift)
and the `/api/v1/leaderboard` query):

| Action | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Register a patient record | **+1000** |
| Each field filled | **+20** |
| Each search | **+10** |

Search actions are logged via `POST /api/v1/events`; field/record counts are
computed from the stored data. Each account also has a Cardano wallet address
shown in the app, tying the contributor to an on-chain identity.

## Cardano anchor

The [`cardano/`](cardano/) workspace runs a local Cardano devnet on the
EffectStream (Paima Engine) packages - yaci-devkit + Dolos + a sync node, no
smart contract, no Docker. The backend's `CardanoAdapter`
([backend/src/adapters/cardano.ts](backend/src/adapters/cardano.ts)) anchors each
hash in **Cardano transaction metadata** (label `8327`) with Lucid, submitting
through the Yaci admin API:

```
metadata 8327 = { t, k, v }
  t = "ipp" (record) | "ipp-study" (Merkle root)
  k = SHA-256(rut)   | study id
  v = SHA-256(canonical patient JSON) | study Merkle root
```

Both `k` and `v` are 32-byte hashes - no identity or medical content ever
reaches the chain. The EffectStream primitive syncs that metadata into the
`ipp_anchors` table, which the adapter reads back. Flip `CHAIN=cardano` in
`backend/.env` (with the devnet running) and the same endpoints that ran against
the no-op `local` adapter now anchor and verify on a real chain.

## On-chain verification

`GET /api/v1/verify/:rut` (and the map's "Verificar en cadena" popup) closes the
loop: it reads the anchor for `SHA-256(rut)` back from `ipp_anchors` and reports

- **chainMatch** - the chain still holds the exact hash we submitted, and
- **recordMatch** - the record *as it stands now* still hashes to the on-chain
  value (flips to `false` if the stored record was altered after anchoring).

The backend recomputes the record hash with a canonical encoder byte-for-byte
identical to the iOS `PatientHasher` (locked by a test vector in
[backend/scripts/verify-canonical.ts](backend/scripts/verify-canonical.ts)), and
the iOS app re-checks independently with its own encoder - so the doctor's device
verifies without trusting the backend.

A **study** anchors one Merkle root over a whole cohort of record hashes
(`t: "ipp-study"`, [backend/src/merkle.ts](backend/src/merkle.ts)); a third party
validates the published dataset by recomputing the root and checking it against
the single on-chain value - no records leave the database.

## Verifiable dataset export

When a doctor exports a cohort for a study or paper, the export is also a
**record**: the filtered set is anchored on Cardano and the file is stamped with
a **Verification ID**, so anyone can later prove the dataset is authentic and
unaltered - without IPP in the loop.

- **Export = anchor.** "Exportar CSV" on the map
  ([web/src/components/MapView.tsx](web/src/components/MapView.tsx)) sends the
  filtered cohort's member ids + `SHA-256(data CSV)` to `POST /api/v1/studies`.
  The backend builds a Merkle root over the members' record hashes and anchors a
  single value binding the cohort *and* the exact file:
  `anchoredValue = SHA-256(recordsRoot + exportHash)` (the two hex hashes
  concatenated). The CSV downloads with a `#`-prefixed header carrying the
  Verification ID, tx, roots and a verify URL - so the ID travels with the data.
- **Proof bundle (hash-only, publishable).** `GET /api/v1/studies/:id` returns
  record-hash **leaves + Merkle inclusion proofs + the chain pointer** - no
  patient data - so it is safe to attach to a paper. Every export is listed in
  the web **Estudios** tab with its Verification ID and a drift check.
- **Anyone verifies, trustlessly.** The public **`/verificar`** page
  ([web/src/components/VerifyStudy.tsx](web/src/components/VerifyStudy.tsx)) and a
  standalone CLI ([scripts/verify-study-bundle.ts](scripts/verify-study-bundle.ts),
  zero IPP deps) recompute the root + inclusion proofs, recompute `anchoredValue`,
  read the anchor **straight from Cardano by tx id** (Blockfrost-compatible: Dolos
  on the devnet, Blockfrost on a public net), and confirm they match - plus an
  optional check that the CSV in hand hashes to the certified file.

`GET /api/v1/verify-study/:id` complements this as the *doctor-side* drift check
(does the live database still match what was published - `datasetIntact`,
`changed`, `missing`), distinct from the public, chain-only proof.

## Reusing the template

IPP is intentionally thin; most of its surface generalizes to other location +
verifiability apps:

- **Schema-driven form** - the questionnaire is a JSON schema in Postgres,
  fetched and cached by both clients. Editing it in the web "Configurar" tab
  reshapes the iOS form on next launch, no App Store release. Any configurable
  intake (surveys, audits, field inspections) drops in here.
- **Swappable `ChainAdapter`** - `local` (no-op) and `cardano` implement one
  `submit` / `read` interface; add a chain by adding an adapter.
- **Metadata-anchor pattern** - a label plus `{ t, k, v }` is the smallest
  useful Cardano anchor for "I have private data and want to prove it hasn't
  changed." No contract required.

## Endpoints

Auth: **Public** = open read; **Doctor** = signed request (see
[Doctor authentication](#doctor-authentication)); **Signed** = patient-key
signature.

## Running it

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env        # set DATABASE_URL (Neon); CHAIN=local or cardano
bun install
bun run dev                 # http://localhost:3334
curl http://localhost:3334/health
# {"status":"ok","chain":"local","storage":"postgres"}
```

Schema is created on startup (idempotent `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`).

### Cardano devnet (for `CHAIN=cardano`)

```bash
cd cardano
bun install                 # one-time (links the EffectStream / Paima packages)
bun run dev                 # yaci-devkit + Dolos + pglite + sync node (no Docker)
```

Then set `CHAIN=cardano` in `backend/.env` and restart the backend.

### Web app

```bash
cd web
bun install                 # one-time
bun run dev                 # http://localhost:5174
```

Backend URL defaults to `http://localhost:3334` (override with `VITE_BACKEND_URL`).

### iOS app

```bash
brew install xcodegen       # one-time
cd ios
xcodegen generate
open IPP.xcodeproj           # pick an iPhone simulator, ⌘R
```

The app talks to `http://localhost:3334` and embeds the web dashboard at
`http://localhost:5174` (both set via `Info.plist`: `BackendURL`, `WebURL`).
Demo logins: `user01`…`user10` / `pass01`…`pass10`.

## Doctor authentication

Doctor-scope endpoints require a **signed request**: the client signs
`${METHOD}|${path}|${timestamp}|${SHA-256(body)}` with an ed25519 key derived
deterministically from the account seed, sending `X-IPP-PubKey` /
`X-IPP-Timestamp` / `X-IPP-Signature` / `X-IPP-Username`. The backend
([backend/src/auth.ts](backend/src/auth.ts)) verifies the signature, checks a
5-minute clock skew, and resolves the key against a `doctors` table
(trust-on-first-use). iOS (CryptoKit) and web (`@noble/ed25519`) derive the
**same** key from the same seed, so a doctor has one identity across both.

## Community write-up

[BLOG.md](BLOG.md) is the long-form write-up of the engineering and use-cases.

## Roadmap

- **Default-trustless web verify** - the standalone CLI and `/verificar` already
  read the anchor directly from Cardano by tx id; make that the web page's
  default (needs a CORS-enabled explorer) so even the browser never trusts IPP.
- **Real signup** - replace the fixed demo-account seeds with per-device keys in
  the iOS Keychain.

## What's intentionally not done

- **AR is augmented *data*, not camera AR.** There is no ARKit/RealityKit
  overlay; the augmentation is the location-aware stats and map planning layer.
- **Demo accounts ship fixed seeds** - fine for a demo, but a real deployment
  needs per-user generated keys (see Roadmap).
- **No smart-contract token mint** - the chain layer is metadata anchoring only.
